## Introduction

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is a powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations that work in all major browsers. It is easy to use, highly flexible, and has a robust set of features that allow you to animate anything you can imagine.

## Setup

To get started with GSAP, you will need basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, along with the CDNs for Tailwind CSS and GSAP. Follow the steps below to set up your environment.

### Step 1: Create the Basic Files

Create the following files in your project directory:

1. `index.html`
2. `styles.css`
3. `script.js`

### Step 2: Include Tailwind CSS and GSAP

Add the following CDNs to your `index.html` file to include Tailwind CSS and GSAP.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
